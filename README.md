# NativeScript example

This is the NativeScript example app. I'll put here my study results.

# Requirements

If you don't have the Node.js and NativeScript installed in your computer, follow the steps on the [NativeScript page](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup).

After that, maybe you need to run the npm command to download some dependencies:

    npm install
